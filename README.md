# ODIN WALDO PROJECT

Welcome to the Odin Waldo project! This project is a fun and interactive web application where users can play a game similar to "Where's Waldo?". The application is built using React for the frontend and Express for the backend, providing a full-stack experience.

## GETTING STARTED:

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your machine. Once you have Node.js installed, you can clone the repository and install the dependencies for both the frontend and backend.

## INSTALLATION:

- Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/lolocompa/odin-waldo.git
- Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:
cd odin-waldo/frontend
npm install
- Navigate to the backend directory in a separate terminal window and install dependencies:
cd odin-waldo/backend
npm install
- Running the Application
Frontend
To run the frontend application, use the following command in the frontend directory:

- npm start
This will start the React application in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

- Backend
To run the backend server, use the following command in the backend directory:

- npm start
The server will start, and by default, it will listen on port 3000. However, CORS is configured to allow requests from http://localhost:3001, so ensure the frontend is running on a different port if running both applications on the same machine.

Available Scripts
In the project directories, you can run several scripts:

- npm start: Runs the app in development mode.
- npm test: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
- npm run build: Builds the app for production to the build folder.
- npm run eject: Removes the single build dependency from your project.
- For more details, refer to the frontend README and backend README (if available).
